        Murphee is an autonomous machine to measure the depths of heavy water containers in dangerous areas of a nuclear power plant.<br /><br /> This, of course, is a proof of concept design. The machine is entirely autonomous, using a PIC16 microcontroller with it's own onboard power supply and circuitry designed by my team and I.
